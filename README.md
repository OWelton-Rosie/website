This is my personal [website](https://website-j83.pages.dev/).
<h1>How it works</h1>
<ul><strong>1:</strong> First, I have to commit a change to the targeted GitHub repo (which is this one).</ul>
<ul><strong>2:</strong></p> Cloudflare pages, which is linked to this repo, automatically detects and deploys any committed changes (either negative or positive).</ul>
<ul><strong>3: </strong> Lastly, the website user will have to refresh the page to view the most recent version. I'm currently working on automation for this.</ul>
