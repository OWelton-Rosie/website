This is my personal [website](https://website-j83.pages.dev/).
<h1>How it works</h1>
<ul><strong>1:</strong> First, I have to commit a change to the targeted GitHub repo (which is this one).</ul>
<ul><strong>2:</strong> Cloudflare pages, which is linked to this repo, automatically detects and deploys any committed changes (either negative or positive, but with the exception of changes that don't affect the published website, such as changes to the README).</ul>
<ul><strong>3: </strong> Lastly, the website user will have to refresh the page to view the most recent version. I'm currently working on automation for this.</ul>
