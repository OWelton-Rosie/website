This is my personal [website](https://website-j83.pages.dev/).
<h1>How it works</h1>
<ul><strong>1:</strong> First, I have to commit a change to the targeted GitHub file [index.html](https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/website/blob/main/index.html).</ul>
<ul><strong>2:</strong> [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), which is linked to my GitHub account, automatically detects and deploys any changes committed to [index.html(https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/website/blob/main/index.html),(either negative or positive, but with the exception of changes that don't affect the published website, such as changes to the README).</ul>
<ul><strong>3: </strong> Lastly, the website user will have to refresh the page to view the most recent version. I'm currently working on automating this.</ul>
