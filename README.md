<p>This is my personal <a href="https://website-j83.pages.dev/">website</a>.<p>
<h1>How it works</h1>
<ul><strong>1:</strong> First, I have to commit a change to the targeted GitHub file (<a href="https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/website/blob/main/index.html">index.html</a>).</ul>
<ul><strong>2:</strong> <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a>, which is linked to my GitHub account, automatically detects and deploys any changes committed to <a href="https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/website/blob/main/index.html">index.html</a> (either negative or positive but excluding changes that don't affect the published website, such as a name change to <a href="https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/website/blob/main/index.html">index.html</a>).</ul>
<ul><strong>3:</strong> Lastly, the website user will have to refresh the page to view the most recent version. I'm currently working on automating this.</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A green tick on the commit page signifies that Cloudflare has deployed the changes.</p>
<h1>Edit schedule</h1>
<p>I don't schedule edits; they often come to me at weird times. However, I typically edit <a href="https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/website/blob/main/index.html">index.html</a> at least twice a day. 
<p>The full commits list (the changelog) can be found <a href="https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/website/commits/main/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that GitHub isn't my primary editor, so it can take up to a few hours for changes to <a href="https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/website/blob/main/index.html">index.html</a> to be committed. It typically takes <30 seconds for changes to be deployed to the website hosted on <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a> .</p>
